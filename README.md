Error responses include detailed error codes and messages that enable effective troubleshooting and error handling in client applications.

Authentication and authorization are implemented consistently across all API endpoints using industry-standard approaches including API keys, JWT tokens, and OAuth 2.0. The API supports role-based access control that enables fine-grained control over which operations different users and applications can perform.

Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms protect the API from abuse and ensure fair resource allocation among different clients. The API includes configurable rate limits based on authentication credentials and usage patterns. Rate limit information is included in response headers to enable clients to implement appropriate retry logic.

### Authentication and Authorization

The API supports multiple authentication methods to accommodate different integration scenarios and security requirements. Each authentication method provides different levels of security and functionality, enabling organizations to choose the approach that best fits their security policies and technical requirements.

API Key authentication provides a simple and effective approach for server-to-server integrations. API keys are generated through the web interface and can be configured with specific permissions and expiration dates. API keys should be included in the Authorization header using the Bearer token format:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication provides enhanced security for user-based integrations. JWT tokens are obtained through the authentication endpoint and include user identity and permission information. JWT tokens have configurable expiration times and can be refreshed using refresh tokens:

```
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "user@company.com",
  "password": "secure_password"
}
```

OAuth 2.0 authentication enables secure integration with third-party applications while maintaining user privacy and security. The API supports the authorization code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security. OAuth applications must be registered through the administrative interface before use.

Role-based access control enables fine-grained control over API access based on user roles and permissions. The API includes predefined roles for common use cases including administrators, quality assurance professionals, developers, and read-only users. Custom roles can be defined to meet specific organizational requirements.

Permission inheritance and delegation enable flexible authorization models that can accommodate complex organizational structures. Users can be granted permissions directly or through group membership, and permissions can be delegated to service accounts for automated integrations.

### Core API Endpoints

The web tier handles user interface delivery and initial request processing. This tier typically includes load balancers, reverse proxies, and web servers that manage SSL termination, request routing, and static content delivery. Consider implementing multiple web tier instances for high availability and load distribution.

The application tier contains the core business logic and AI processing components. This tier should be deployed across multiple instances to ensure availability and enable horizontal scaling based on demand. Application tier instances should be stateless to enable easy scaling and load distribution.

The data tier includes database servers, caching systems, and file storage components. Implement database clustering or replication for high availability and consider read replicas for query-intensive workloads. Use dedicated caching systems such as Redis for session management and application caching.

Network architecture should implement appropriate segmentation between tiers with firewall rules that restrict access to only necessary ports and protocols. Consider implementing a DMZ (demilitarized zone) for web-facing components and restricting direct access to application and data tiers from external networks.

    kind: Deployment
    name: ai-test-generator
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

### Monitoring and Observability

Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability to ensure system health and performance. Monitoring should include application metrics, infrastructure metrics, and business metrics that provide insights into system usage and effectiveness.

Application monitoring should track key performance indicators including response times, error rates, throughput, and resource utilization. Use application performance monitoring (APM) tools such as New Relic, Datadog, or open-source alternatives like Prometheus and Grafana.

Infrastructure monitoring should track server health, network performance, and resource utilization across all system components. Monitor database performance including query execution times, connection pool usage, and storage utilization.

Business metrics should track system usage patterns including document processing volumes, test case generation rates, and compliance assessment frequency. These metrics provide insights into system value and help identify optimization opportunities.

Configure alerting for critical system events including service failures, performance degradation, and security incidents. Implement escalation procedures to ensure that critical issues are addressed promptly.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

Implement comprehensive backup and disaster recovery procedures to protect against data loss and ensure business continuity. Backup strategies should address both data protection and system recovery requirements.

Database backups should be performed regularly with both full and incremental backup strategies. Test backup restoration procedures regularly to ensure that backups are valid and recovery procedures are effective. Consider implementing point-in-time recovery capabilities for critical data.

File storage backups should include all uploaded documents, generated reports, and system configuration files. Use versioned storage systems to enable recovery of specific file versions when needed.

Configuration backups should include all system configuration files, integration settings, and security configurations. Store configuration backups in version control systems to enable tracking of changes and rollback capabilities.

Disaster recovery procedures should include detailed steps for system restoration in different failure scenarios. Document recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) based on business requirements. Test disaster recovery procedures regularly to ensure effectiveness.

### Security Hardening

Implement comprehensive security hardening measures to protect against various threat vectors. Security hardening should address both infrastructure and application security concerns.

Network security should include firewall configuration, network segmentation, and intrusion detection systems. Implement VPN or private network connectivity for administrative access. Use SSL/TLS encryption for all network communications.

Application security should include input validation, output encoding, and protection against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Implement security headers and content security policies to protect against client-side attacks.

Access control should implement the principle of least privilege with role-based access controls and regular access reviews. Use multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts and consider implementing single sign-on for user convenience and security.

Data protection should include encryption at rest and in transit, secure key management, and data classification policies. Implement data retention and disposal policies that comply with regulatory requirements.

Regular security assessments should include vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and security code reviews. Address identified vulnerabilities promptly and maintain an inventory of security patches and updates.
